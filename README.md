# The Modern JavaScript Tutorial

This repository hosts the English content of the Modern JavaScript Tutorial, published in [https://javascript.info](https://javascript.info).

## Translations

We'd like to make the tutorial available in many languages. Please help us to translate.

Something's wrong? A topic is missing? Explain it to people, add as PR 👏

**You can edit the text in any editor.** The tutorial uses enhanced "markdown" format, easy to grasp. And if you want to see how it looks on-site, there's a server to run the tutorial locally at <https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/server>.  

The list of contributors is available at <https://javascript.info/about#contributors>.

## Structure

Every chapter, article or a task has its folder.

The folder is named like `N-url`, where `N` is a number for the sorting purposes and `url` is the URL part with title of the material.

The type of the material is defined by the file inside the folder:

  - `index.md` stands for a chapter
  - `article.md` stands for an article
  - `task.md` stands for a task (solution must be provided in `solution.md` file as well)

Each of these files starts from the `# Main header`.

It's very easy to add something new.
