# Animate a plane (CSS)

Show the animation like on the picture below (click the plane):

[iframe src="solution" height=300]

- The picture grows on click from `40x24px` to `400x240px` (10 times larger).
- The animation takes 3 seconds.
- At the end output: "Done!".
- During the animation process, there may be more clicks on the plane. They shouldn't "break" anything.
