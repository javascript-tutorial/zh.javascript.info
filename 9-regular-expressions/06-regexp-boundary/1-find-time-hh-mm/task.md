# Find the time

The time has a format: `hours:minutes`. Both hours and minutes has two digits, like `09:00`.

Make a regexp to find time in the string: `subject:Breakfast at 09:00 in the room 123:456.`

P.S. In this task there's no need to check time correctness yet, so `25:99` can also be a valid result.

P.P.S. The regexp shouldn't match `123:456`.
