# How many seconds have passed today?

Write a function `getSecondsToday()` that returns the number of seconds from the beginning of today.

For instance, if now were `10:00 am`, and there was no daylight savings shift, then:

```js
getSecondsToday() == 36000 // (3600 * 10)
```

The function should work in any day. That is, it should not have a hard-coded value of "today".
