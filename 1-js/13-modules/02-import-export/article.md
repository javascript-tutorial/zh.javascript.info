# Export and Import

Export and import directives are very versatile.

In the previous chapter we saw a simple use, now let's explore more examples.

## Export before declarations

We can label any declaration as exported by placing `export` before it, be it a variable, function or a class.

For instance, here all exports are valid:

```js
// export an array
*!*export*/!* let months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar','Apr', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'];

// export a constant
*!*export*/!* const MODULES_BECAME_STANDARD_YEAR = 2015;

// export a class
*!*export*/!* class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

````smart header="No semicolons after export class/function"
Please note that `export` before a class or a function does not make it a [function expression](info:function-expressions-arrows). It's still a function declaration, albeit exported.

Most JavaScript style guides recommend semicolons after statements, but not after function and class declarations.

That's why there should be no semicolons at the end of `export class` and `export function`.

```js
export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
} *!* // no ; at the end */!*
```

````

## Export apart from declarations

Also, we can put `export` separately.

Here we first declare, and then export:

```js  
// üìÅ say.js
function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}

function sayBye(user) {
  alert(`Bye, ${user}!`);
}

*!*
export {sayHi, sayBye}; // a list of exported variables
*/!*
```

...Or, technically we could put `export` above functions as well.

## Import *

Usually, we put a list of what to import into `import {...}`, like this:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
*!*
import {sayHi, sayBye} from './say.js';
*/!*

sayHi('John'); // Hello, John!
sayBye('John'); // Bye, John!
```

But if the list is long, we can import everything as an object using `import * as <obj>`, for instance:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
*!*
import * as say from './say.js';
*/!*

say.sayHi('John');
say.sayBye('John');
```

At first sight, "import everything" seems such a cool thing, short to write, why should we ever explicitly list what we need to import?

Well, there are few reasons.

1. Modern build tools ([webpack](http://webpack.github.io) and others) bundle modules together and optimize them to speedup loading and remove unused stuff.

    Let's say, we added a 3rd-party library `lib.js` to our project with many functions:
    ```js
    // üìÅ lib.js
    export function sayHi() { ... }
    export function sayBye() { ... }
    export function becomeSilent() { ... }
    ```

    Now if we only use one of `lib.js` functions in our project:
    ```js
    // üìÅ main.js
    import {sayHi} from './lib.js';
    ```
    ...Then the optimizer will automatically detect it and totally remove the other functions from the bundled code, thus making the build smaller. That is called "tree-shaking".

2. Explicitly listing what to import gives shorter names: `sayHi()` instead of `lib.sayHi()`.
3. Explicit imports give better overview of the code structure: what is used and where. It makes code support and refactoring easier.

## Import "as"

We can also use `as` to import under different names.

For instance, let's import `sayHi` into the local variable `hi` for brevity, and same for `sayBye`:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
*!*
import {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye} from './say.js';
*/!*

hi('John'); // Hello, John!
bye('John'); // Bye, John!
```

## Export "as"

The similar syntax exists for `export`.

Let's export functions as `hi` and `bye`:

```js
// üìÅ say.js
...
export {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye};
```

Now `hi` and `bye` are official names for outsiders:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import * as say from './say.js';

say.hi('John'); // Hello, John!
say.bye('John'); // Bye, John!
```

## export default

So far, we've seen how to import/export multiple things, optionally "as" other names.

In practice, modules contain either:
- A library, pack of functions, like `lib.js`.
- Or an entity, like `class User` is described in `user.js`, the whole module has only this class.

Mostly, the second approach is preferred, so that every "thing" resides in its own module.

Naturally, that requires a lot of files, as everything wants its own module, but that's not a problem at all. Actually, code navigation becomes easier, if files are well-named and structured into folders.

Modules provide special `export default` syntax to make "one thing per module" way look better.

It requires following `export` and `import` statements:

1. Put `export default` before the "main export" of the module.
2. Call `import` without curly braces.

For instance, here `user.js` exports `class User`:

```js
// üìÅ user.js
export *!*default*/!* class User { // just add "default"
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

...And `main.js` imports it:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import *!*User*/!* from './user.js'; // not {User}, just User

new User('John');
```

Imports without curly braces look nicer. A common mistake when starting to use modules is to forget curly braces at all. So, remember, `import` needs curly braces for named imports and doesn't need them for the default one.

| Named export | Default export |
|--------------|----------------|
| `export class User {...}` | `export default class User {...}` |
| `import {User} from ...` | `import User from ...`|

Naturally, there may be only one "default" export per file.

We may have both default and named exports in a single module, but in practice people usually don't mix them. A module has either named exports or the default one.

**Another thing to note is that named exports must (naturally) have a name, while `export default` may be anonymous.**

For instance, these are all perfectly valid default exports:

```js
export default class { // no class name
  constructor() { ... }
}

export default function(user) { // no function name
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}

// export a single value, without making a variable
export default ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar','Apr', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'];
```

That's fine, because `export default` is only one per file. Contrary to that, omitting a name for named imports would be an error:

```js
export class { // Error! (non-default export needs a name)
  constructor() {}
}
```     

### "Default" alias

The "default" keyword is used as an "alias" for the default export, for standalone exports and other scenarios when we need to reference it.

For example, if we already have a function declared, that's how to `export default` it (separately from the definition):

```js
function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}

export {sayHi as default}; // same as if we added "export default" before the function
```

Or, let's say a module `user.js` exports one main "default" thing and a few named ones (rarely the case, but happens):

```js
// üìÅ user.js
export default class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}
```

Here's how to import the default export along with a named one:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import {*!*default as User*/!*, sayHi} from './user.js';

new User('John');
```

Or, if we consider importing `*` as an object, then the `default` property is exactly the default export:

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import * as user from './user.js';

let User = user.default;
new User('John');
```


### Should I use default exports?

One should be careful about using default exports, because they are more difficult to maintain.

Named exports are explicit. They exactly name what they import, so we have that information from them, that's a good thing.

Also, named exports enforce us to use exactly the right name to import:

```js
import {User} from './user.js';
// import {MyUser} won't work, the name must be {User}
```

For default exports, we always choose the name when importing:

```js
import User from './user.js'; // works
import MyUser from './user.js'; // works too
// could be import Anything..., and it'll be work
```

So, there's a little bit more freedom that can be abused, so that team members may use different names for the same thing.

Usually, to avoid that and keep the code consistent, there's a rule that imported variables should correspond to file names, e.g:

```js
import User from './user.js';
import LoginForm from './loginForm.js';
import func from '/path/to/func.js';
...
```

Another solution would be to use named exports everywhere. Even if only a single thing is exported, it's still exported under a name, without `default`.

That also makes re-export (see below) a little bit easier.

## Re-export

"Re-export" syntax `export ... from ...` allows to import things and immediately export them (possibly under another name), like this:

```js
export {sayHi} from './say.js';
export {default as User} from './user.js';
```

What's the point, why that's needed? Let's see a practical use case.

Imagine, we're writing a "package": a folder with a lot of modules, mostly needed internally, with some of the functionality exported outside (tools like NPM allow to publish and distribute packages, but here it doesn't matter).

A directory structure could be like this:
```
auth/
  index.js  
  user.js
  helpers.js
  tests/
    login.js
  providers/
    github.js
    facebook.js
    ...
```

We'd like to expose the package functionality via a single entry point, the "main file" `auth/index.js`, to be used like this:

```js
import {login, logout} from 'auth/index.js'
```

The idea is that outsiders, developers who use our package, should not meddle with its internal structure. They should not search for files inside our package folder. We export only what's necessary in `auth/index.js` and keep the rest hidden from prying eyes.

Now, as the actual exported functionality is scattered among the package, we can gather and "re-export" it in `auth/index.js`:

```js
// üìÅ auth/index.js
import {login, logout} from './helpers.js';
export {login, logout};

import User from './user.js';
export {User};

import Github from './providers/github.js';
export {Github};
...
```

"Re-exporting" is just a shorter notation for that:

```js
// üìÅ auth/index.js
export {login, logout} from './helpers.js';
// or, to re-export all helpers, we could use:
// export * from './helpers.js';

export {default as User} from './user.js';

export {default as Github} from './providers/github.js';
...
```

````warn header="Re-exporting default is tricky"
Please note: `export User from './user.js'` won't work. It's actually a syntax error. To re-export the default export, we must mention it explicitly `{default as ...}`, like in the example above.

Also, there's another oddity: `export * from './user.js'` re-exports only named exports, excluding the default one. Once again, we need to mention it explicitly.

For instance, to re-export everything, two statements will be necessary:
```js
export * from './module.js'; // to re-export named exports
export {default} from './module.js'; // to re-export default
```

The default should be mentioned explicitly only when re-exporting: `import * as obj` works fine. It imports the default export as `obj.default`. So there's a slight asymmetry between import and export constructs here.
````

## Summary

There are following types of `export`:

- Before declaration:
  - `export [default] class/function/variable ...`
- Standalone:
  - `export {x [as y], ...}`.
- Re-export:
  - `export {x [as y], ...} from "mod"`
  - `export * from "mod"` (doesn't re-export default).
  - `export {default [as y]} from "mod"` (re-export default).

Import:

- Named exports from module:
  - `import {x [as y], ...} from "mod"`
- Default export:  
  - `import x from "mod"`
  - `import {default as x} from "mod"`
- Everything:
  - `import * as obj from "mod"`
- Import the module (it runs), but do not assign it to a variable:
  - `import "mod"`

We can put import/export statements at the top or at the bottom of a script, that doesn't matter.

So this is technically fine:
```js
sayHi();

// ...

import {sayHi} from './say.js'; // import at the end of the script
```

In practice imports are usually at the start of the file, but that's only for better convenience.

**Please note that import/export statements don't work if inside `{...}`.**

A conditional import, like this, won't work:
```js
if (something) {
  import {sayHi} from "./say.js"; // Error: import must be at top level
}
```

...But what if we really need to import something conditionally? Or at the right time? Like, load a module upon request, when it's really needed?

We'll see dynamic imports in the next chapter.
