# Extended clock

We've got a `Clock` class. As of now, it prints the time every second.


[js src="source.view/clock.js"]

Create a new class `ExtendedClock` that inherits from `Clock` and adds the parameter `precision` -- the number of `ms` between "ticks". Should be `1000` (1 second) by default.

- Your code should be in the file `extended-clock.js`
- Don't modify the original `clock.js`. Extend it.
