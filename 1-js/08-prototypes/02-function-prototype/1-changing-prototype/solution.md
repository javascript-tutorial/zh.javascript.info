1. `true`. 

    The assignment to `Rabbit.prototype` sets up `[[Prototype]]` for new objects, but it does not affect the existing ones. 

2. `false`. 

    Objects are assigned by reference. The object from `Rabbit.prototype` is not duplicated, it's still a single object referenced both by `Rabbit.prototype` and by the `[[Prototype]]` of `rabbit`. 

    So when we change its content through one reference, it is visible through the other one.

3. `true`.

    All `delete` operations are applied directly to the object. Here `delete rabbit.eats` tries to remove `eats` property from `rabbit`, but it doesn't have it. So the operation won't have any effect.

4. `undefined`.

    The property `eats` is deleted from the prototype, it doesn't exist any more.
