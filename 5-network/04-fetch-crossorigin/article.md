# Fetch: Cross-Origin Requests

If we make a `fetch` from an arbitrary web-site, that will probably fail.

The core concept here is *origin* -- a domain/port/protocol triplet.

Cross-origin requests -- those sent to another domain (even a subdomain) or protocol or port -- require special headers from the remote side. That policy is called "CORS": Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

For instance, let's try fetching `http://example.com`:

```js run async
try {
  await fetch('http://example.com');
} catch(err) {
  alert(err); // Failed to fetch
}
```

Fetch fails, as expected.

## Why?

Because cross-origin restrictions protect the internet from evil hackers.

Seriously. Let's make a very brief historical digression.

For many years Javascript did not have any special methods to perform network requests.

**A script from one site could not access the content of another site.**

That simple, yet powerful rule was a foundation of the internet security. E.g. a script from the page `hacker.com` could not access user's mailbox at `gmail.com`. People felt safe.

But web developers demanded more power. A variety of tricks were invented to work around it.

One way to communicate with another server was to submit a `<form>` there. People submitted it into `<iframe>`, just to stay on the current page, like this:

```html
<!-- form target -->
<iframe name="iframe"></iframe>

<!-- a form could be dynamically generated and submited by Javascript -->
<form target="iframe" method="POST" action="http://another.com/…">
  ...
</form>

```

- So, it was possible to make a GET/POST request to another site, even without networking methods.
- But as it's forbidden to access the content of an `<iframe>` from another site, it wasn't possible to read the response.

So, `<form>` allowed to submit the data anywhere, but the response content was unaccessible.

Another trick was to use a `<script src="http://another.com/…">` tag. A script could have any `src`, from any domain. But again -- it was impossible to access the raw content of such script.

If `another.com` intended to expose data for this kind of access, then a so-called "JSONP (JSON with padding)" protocol was used.

Here's the flow:

1. First, in advance, we declare a global function to accept the data, e.g. `gotWeather`.
2. Then we make a `<script>` and pass its name as the `callback` query parameter, e.g. `src="http://another.com/weather.json?callback=gotWeather"`.
3. The remote server dynamically generates a response that wraps the data into `gotWeather(...)` call.  
4. As the script executes, `gotWeather` runs, and, as it's our function, we have the data.

Here's an example of the code to receive the data in JSONP:

```js run
// 1. Declare the function to process the data
function gotWeather({ temperature, humidity }) {
  alert(`temperature: ${temperature}, humidity: ${humidity}`);
}

// 2. Pass its name as the ?callback parameter for the script
let script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = `https://cors.javascript.info/article/fetch-crossorigin/demo/script?callback=gotWeather`;
document.body.append(script);

// 3. The expected answer from the server looks like this:
/*
gotWeather({
  temperature: 25,
  humidity: 78
});
*/
```


That works, and doesn't violate security, because both sides agreed to pass the data this way. And, when both sides agree, it's definitely not a hack. There are still services that provide such access, as it works even for very old browsers.

After a while, modern network methods appeared. At first, cross-origin requests were forbidden. But as a result of long discussions, cross-domain requests were  allowed, in a way that does not add any capabilities unless explicitly allowed by the server.

## Simple requests

[Simple requests](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#terminology) must satisfy the following conditions:

1. [Simple method](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#simple-method): GET, POST or HEAD
2. [Simple headers](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#simple-header) -- only allowed:
    - `Accept`,
    - `Accept-Language`,
    - `Content-Language`,
    - `Content-Type` with the value `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data` or `text/plain`.

Any other request is considered "non-simple". For instance, a request with `PUT` method or with an `API-Key` HTTP-header does not fit the limitations.

**The essential difference is that a "simple request" can be made with a `<form>` or a `<script>`, without any special methods.**

So, even a very old server should be ready to accept a simple request.

Contrary to that, requests with non-standard headers or e.g. method `DELETE` can't be created this way. For a long time Javascript was unable to do such requests. So an old server may assume that such requests come from a privileged source, "because a webpage is unable to send them".

When we try to make a non-simple request, the browser sends a special "preflight" request that asks the server -- does it agree to accept such cross-origin requests, or not?

And, unless the server explicitly confirms that with headers, a non-simple request is not sent.

Now we'll go into details. All of them serve a single purpose -- to ensure that new cross-origin capabilities are only accessible with an explicit permission from the server.

## CORS for simple requests

If a request is cross-origin, the browser always adds `Origin` header to it.

For instance, if we request `https://anywhere.com/request` from `https://javascript.info/page`, the headers will be like:

```
GET /request
Host: anywhere.com
*!*
Origin: https://javascript.info
*/!*
...
```

As you can see, `Origin` contains exactly the origin (domain/protocol/port), without a path.

The server can inspect the `Origin` and, if it agrees to accept such a request, adds a special header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the response. That header should contain the allowed origin (in our case `https://javascript.info`), or a star `*`. Then the response is successful, otherwise an error.

The browser plays the role of a trusted mediator here:
1. It ensures that the corrent `Origin` is sent with a cross-domain request.
2. If checks for correct `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in the response, if it is so, then Javascript access, otherwise forbids with an error.

![](xhr-another-domain.png)

Here's an example of an "accepting" response:
```
200 OK
Content-Type:text/html; charset=UTF-8
*!*
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info
*/!*
```

## Response headers

For cross-origin request, by default Javascript may only access "simple response headers":

- `Cache-Control`
- `Content-Language`
- `Content-Type`
- `Expires`
- `Last-Modified`
- `Pragma`

Any other response header is forbidden.

```smart header="Please note: no `Content-Length`"
Please note: there's no `Content-Length` header in the list!

So, if we're downloading something and would like to track the percentage of progress, then an additional permission is required to access that header (see below).
```

To grant Javascript access to any other response header, the server must list it in the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header.

For example:

```
200 OK
Content-Type:text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 12345
API-Key: 2c9de507f2c54aa1
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info
*!*
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Length,API-Key
*/!*
```

With such `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header, the script is allowed to access `Content-Length` and `API-Key` headers of the response.


## "Non-simple" requests

We can use any HTTP-method: not just `GET/POST`, but also `PATCH`, `DELETE` and others.

Some time ago no one could even assume that a webpage is able to do such requests. So there may exist webservices that treat a non-standard method as a signal: "That's not a browser". They can take it into account when checking access rights.

So, to avoid misunderstandings, any "non-simple" request -- that couldn't be done in the old times, the browser does not make such requests right away. Before it sends a preliminary, so-called "preflight" request, asking for permission.

A preflight request uses method `OPTIONS` and has no body.
- `Access-Control-Request-Method` header has the requested method.
- `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header provides a comma-separated list of non-simple HTTP-headers.

If the server agrees to serve the requests, then it should respond with status 200, without body.

- The response header `Access-Control-Allow-Method` must have the allowed method.
- The response header `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` must have a list of allowed headers.
- Additionally, the header `Access-Control-Max-Age` may specify a number of seconds to cache the permissions. So the browser won't have to send a preflight for subsequent requests that satisfy given permissions.

![](xhr-preflight.png)

Let's see how it works step-by-step on example, for a cross-domain `PATCH` request (this method is often used to update data):

```js
let response = await fetch('https://site.com/service.json', {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'  
    'API-Key': 'secret'
  }
});
```

There are three reasons why the request is not simple (one is enough):
- Method `PATCH`
- `Content-Type` is not one of: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`,  `text/plain`.
- Custom `API-Key` header.

### Step 1 (preflight request)

The browser, on its own, sends a preflight request that looks like this:

```
OPTIONS /service.json
Host: site.com
Origin: https://javascript.info
Access-Control-Request-Method: PATCH
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type,API-Key
```

- Method: `OPTIONS`.
- The path -- exactly the same as the main request: `/service.json`.
- Cross-origin special headers:
    - `Origin` -- the source origin.
    - `Access-Control-Request-Method` -- requested method.
    - `Access-Control-Request-Headers` -- a comma-separated list of "non-simple" headers.

### Step 2 (preflight response)

The server should respond with status 200 and headers:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Method: PATCH`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,API-Key`.

That would allow future communication, otherwise an error is triggered.

If the server expects other methods and headers, makes sense to list them all at once, e.g:

```
200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT,PATCH,DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: API-Key,Content-Type,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
```

Now the browser can see that `PATCH` is in the list of allowed methods, and both headers are in the list too, so it sends out the main request.

Besides, the preflight response is cached for time, specified by `Access-Control-Max-Age` header (86400 seconds, one day), so subsequent requests will not cause a preflight. Assuming that they fit the allowances, they will be sent directly.

### Step 3 (actual request)

When the preflight is successful, the browser now makes the real request. Here the flow is the same as for simple requests.

The real request has `Origin` header (because it's cross-origin):

```
PATCH /service.json
Host: site.com
Content-Type: application/json
API-Key: secret
Origin: https://javascript.info
```

### Step 4 (actual response)

The server should not forget to add `Accept-Control-Allow-Origin` to the response. A successful preflight does not relieve from that:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info
```

Now everything's correct. Javascript is able to read the full response.


## Credentials

A cross-origin request by default does not bring any credentials (cookies or HTTP authentication).

That's uncommon for HTTP-requests. Usually, a request to `http://site.com` is accompanied by all cookies from that domain. But cross-domain requests made by Javascript methods are an exception.

For example, `fetch('http://another.com')` does not send any cookies, even those that belong to `another.com` domain.

Why?

That's because a request with credentials is much more powerful than an anonymous one. If allowed, it grants Javascript the full power to act and access sensitive information on behalf of a user.

Does the server really trust pages from `Origin` that much? A request with credentials needs an additional header to pass through.

To enable credentials, we need to add the option `credentials: "include"`, like this:

```js
fetch('http://another.com', {
  credentials: "include"
});
```

Now `fetch` sends cookies originating from `another.com` with the request.

If the server wishes to accept the request with credentials, it should add a header `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` to the response, in addition to `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.

For example:

```
200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://javascript.info
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

Please note: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is prohibited from using a star `*` for requests with credentials. There must be exactly the origin there, like above. That's an additional safety measure, to ensure that the server really knows who it trusts.


## Summary

Networking methods split cross-origin requests into two kinds: "simple" and all the others.

[Simple requests](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#terminology) must satisfy the following conditions:
- Method: GET, POST or HEAD.
- Headers -- we can set only:
    - `Accept`
    - `Accept-Language`
    - `Content-Language`
    - `Content-Type` to the value `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data` or `text/plain`.

The essential difference is that simple requests were doable since ancient times using `<form>` or `<script>` tags, while non-simple were impossible for browsers for a long time.

So, practical difference is that simple requests are sent right away, with `Origin` header, but for other ones the browser makes a preliminary "preflight" request, asking for permission.

**For simple requests:**

- → The browser sends `Origin` header with the origin.
- ← For requests without credentials (default), the server should set:
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `*` or same as `Origin`
- ← For requests with credentials, the server should set:
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `Origin`
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` to `true`

Additionally, if Javascript wants no access non-simple response headers:
- `Cache-Control`
- `Content-Language`
- `Content-Type`
- `Expires`
- `Last-Modified`
- `Pragma`

...Then the server should list the allowed ones in `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header.

**For non-simple requests, a preliminary "preflight" request is issued before the requested one:**

- → The browser sends `OPTIONS` request to the same url, with headers:
    - `Access-Control-Request-Method` has requested method.
    - `Access-Control-Request-Headers` lists non-simple requested headers
- ← The server should respond with status 200 and headers:
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Method` with a list of allowed methods,
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` with a list of allowed headers,
    - `Access-Control-Max-Age` with a number of seconds to cache permissions.
- Then the actual request is sent, the previous "simple" scheme is applied.
